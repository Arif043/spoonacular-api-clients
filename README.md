# spoonacular API Clients

This repository contains source code for the [spoonacular Recipe and Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). The source code is free to use, all you need is an API key from spoonacular.

Check out what [people have built](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/apps) using the API.

If you have questions or ideas, I'd be happy to [hear from you](https://spoonacular.com/contact).
